# wwo_windspeed
Jupyter Notebook implementation of World Weather Online's superb [API](https://github.com/ekapope/WorldWeatherOnline) to collect weather data

This package is used to retrieve and transform historical weather data from www.worldweatheronline.com into pandas dataframe and csv.
I used this to plot the maximum daily wind speeds in my locality using matplotlib, seaborn and windrose.
